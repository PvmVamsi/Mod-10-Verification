# Mod-10-Verification
This project focuses on verifying a Mod-10 counter design using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The counter operates with a 4-bit output, counting from 0 to 9 and resetting to 0 upon reaching its terminal count. The verification environment includes essential UVM components like the driver, sequencer, monitor, and scoreboard to ensure thorough functional coverage.

The testbench generates a variety of stimulus scenarios, including reset, continuous counting, wrap-around behavior, and illegal states. The monitor captures output transitions, while the scoreboard checks expected results against the DUTâ€™s responses. Functional and code coverage metrics are collected to guarantee design robustness, with assertions added to validate critical timing and state transitions.

By leveraging UVM, the verification ensures the Mod-10 counter adheres to design specifications, achieving comprehensive coverage and reliable validation of corner cases.
